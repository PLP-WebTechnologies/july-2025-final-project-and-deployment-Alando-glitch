# My Website Project

A simple **responsive multipage website** built with:

- **HTML5** for semantic structure
- **CSS3** for styling & responsiveness
- **JavaScript** for interactivity (image slider + form validation)

## Pages
- **Home (`index.html`)**: Hero section and image slider.
- **About (`about.html`)**: Project overview with a responsive grid.
- **Contact (`contact.html`)**: Accessible contact form with client-side validation.

## Notes
- The site is responsive and includes a mobile hamburger menu.
- The slider auto-plays and can be navigated with Previous/Next controls.
- The contact form includes basic client-side validation.
